Molecular Analysis

MLH1 Promoter Metnyiation’ PRESENT IF
COMMENT CAE
Given the molecular findings, the loss of MLH1 is most likely sporadic in nature. Untess there is a sugge a

hereditary Gandition (i.e. compelling family hestory, diagnosis under age 50. polyposis), then a referral to genetics is
not indicated at this tme, UL 2
Molecular Testing — Technical Details 3 2024
OMA extracted from microdissected tumour tissue was treated with sodium bsulfite, followed by amplification of a
segment of the MLH1 [NM_000249.3] promoter region (0.-248_-178) using methylation specific real-time PCR on the
Roche LightCyoler $6, The methylation status of MLH1 js. determined by calouileting the percentage of methylated
feference (PMR) by comparing the ampiificaten of MLH1 to the amplification of the reference gene Alu, Methylation

at locations other {han those covered by the primers and probes will not be detected, Results of this test must always

be interpreted within the clinical context and other relevant data, and shauld not be used alone for 2 diagnosis of
malignancy This test is not intended to detect minimal residual decease

These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by Mount Sinai Hospital, Department
of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. This laboiatery is accredited to |SO 15189 Plus by Accreditation Canada
Diagnostics. These tests were validated according to accepted practice quidelines for clinical molecular genetic
testing by the ACMG anc CCMG.

PATHOLOGY DIAGNOSIS.

« Intestinal metaplasia; negative for dysplasia

4. Stomach (mass), biopsy
