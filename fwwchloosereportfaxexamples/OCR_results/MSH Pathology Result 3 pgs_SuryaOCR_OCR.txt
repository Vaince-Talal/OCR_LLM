SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
ADDENDUM (June 6th, 2024):
mmunahistochemistry
Mismatch Repair (MMR): MLHT deficient (acrormal MLH1 / PMS2 staining dMMR)
Tumour considered MSI-H
PD-L1: Positive (CPS > 5 (40)
HER2: Negative (0)
ADDENDUM (July 12, 2024).
Molecular Analysis.
MLHT Promoter Memylanoni, BRESENT
COMMENT
Given the molecular findings, the loss of M.H. Is most likely sporadio in nature. Unless there is a suggestioner a
hereditary condition (i.e. compelling ramily history, diagnosis under age 50, polyposis), then a referral to genetica is
not indicated at this time.
UL 2 3 2024
Molecular Testing - Technical Details
DNA extracted from microdissected tumour tissue was treated with socium bisuffite, followed by amplification of a
segment of the MLH [NM_000249.3] promoter region (c .- 248 - 778) using methylation specific real-lime PCR an the
Roohe LightOyoler 96. The methylation status of MLH1 is determined by caloulating the percentage of methylated
reference (PMR) by companing the ampilication of MLH1 to the ampilitication of the reference gene Au. Melhyladian
at locations other than those covered by the primers and probles will not be dated of this test must always
be interpreted within the clinical context and should not be used alone for a diagness of
malignancy. This test is not intended to detect minimal residual disease.
These tests were developed and their performance characterisics determined by Mount Sinai Hospital, Department
of Pathology and Laboralory Medicine. This laboratory is accredited to ISO 15189 Plus by Accreditation Canada
Diagnostics These tests were validated according to accepted practice guidelines for clinical molecular genetic
testing by the ACMG and OCMG.
PATHOLOGY DIAGNOSIS
1, 2. Duodenum (02, cap), biopsies:
- Mild intraepithelial lymphocytosis (likely secondary to Heliaobacter pylori gastribs)
3. Stornach (antrum and body), blopsy:
- Active chronic gastrris; Helicobacter pylori identified with histocitemical stains (H. pylon gastritis)
路 Intestinal metaplasia, negative for dysplasia
4. Stomach (mass), biopsy
路 Moderately differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma (intestinal type)
路 Immunohistochemical biomarkers pending
