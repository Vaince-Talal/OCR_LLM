The LU criteria for Ozempic are consistent with the previous therapeutic notes and
with the Health Canada-approved indication of type 2 diabetes. Ozempic is not funded
for ODB program recipients who do not meet the LU criteria on the Formulary. Claims
for payment for dispensing Ozempic for ODB program recipients who do not meet the LU
requirement will be subject to recovery. Claims for payment for Ozempic must be
supported by a prescription that includes the applicable Reason for Use (RFU) code,
as described further in the Ontario Drug Programs Reference Manual.
Between January 31, 2024 to April 30, 2024, pharmacists can use LU Code 279 to submit
a claim for Ozempic (DINS 02471469, 02471477, 02540258) if they are unable to contact
a patient's prescriber to obtain a new prescription with the LU criteria. This will
ensure patients do not go without their drug until they are able to contact their
prescriber
The rules regarding the use of LU code 279 are set out in the Ontario Drug Programs
Reference Manual. Please refer to the Executive Officer Notice for more information.
RFU Code 279 may be used for up to three months until a new LU prescription is

on LU prescriptions. If the RFU code has been discontinued: RFU Code 279 may be used

Dear Dr,
