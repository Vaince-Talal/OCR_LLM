SUPPLEMENTAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
ADDENDUM (June 6th, 2024):
Immunohistochemistry:
Mismatch Repair (MMR): MLH1 deficient (abnormal MLH1 / PMS2 staining dMMR)
Tumour considered MSI-H
PD-L1: Positive (CPS >5 (40)
HER2 Negative (0)
ADDENDUM (July 12, 2024).
Molecular Analysis:
declines
investigation / treatment
send to
PCP
MLH1 Promoter Methylation: PRESENT
COMMENT
FAXE
Given the molecular findings, the loss of MLH1 is most likely sporadic in nature. Unless there is a suggestion for a
hereditary condition (i.e. compelling family history, diagnosis under age 50, polyposis), then a referral to genetics is
not indicated at this time.
JUL 23 2024
Molecular Testing-Technical Details
DNA extracted from microdissected tumour tissue was treated with sodium bisulfite, followed by amplification of a
segment of the MLH1 [NM_000249 3] promoter region (0-248--178) using methylation specific real-time PCR on the
Roche LightCycler 96 The methylation status of MLH1 is determined by calculating the percentage of methylated
reference (PMR) by comparing the amplification of MLH1 to the amplification of the reference gene Alu. Methylation
at locations other than those covered by the primers and probes will not be detected. Results of this test must always
be interpreted within the clinical context and other relevant data, and should not be used alone for a diagnosis of
malignancy. This test is not intended to detect minimal residual disease.
These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by Mount Sinai Hospital, Department
of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. This laboratory is accredited to ISO 15189 Plus by Accreditation Canada
Diagnostics. These tests were validated according to accepted practice guidelines for clinical molecular genetic
testing by the ACMG and CCMG.
PATHOLOGY DIAGNOSIS
1.2. Duodenum (D2, cap), biopsies:
- Mild intraepithelial lymphocytosis (likely secondary to Helicobacter pylori gastritis)
3. Stomach (antrum and body), biopsy:
- Active chronic gastritis; Helicobacter pylori identified with histochemical stains (H. pylori gastritis)
- Intestinal metaplasia; negative for dysplasia
4. Stomach (mass), biopsy:
. Moderately differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma (intestinal type)
- Immunohistochemical biomarkers pending
